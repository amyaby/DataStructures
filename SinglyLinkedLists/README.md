A Linked List is a linear data structure, similar to an array, but with the advantage of allowing easy insertion and deletion of data. In a linked list, we have nodes, and each node can be thought of as a link in a chain. Each node contains data and an address (pointer) to the next node. Each node is a struct, and we need to allocate memory for it using malloc. The list starts with a head that points to the first node in the list.
